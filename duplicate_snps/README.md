First the BGEN.v-1.2 was converted to plink 1.9 format, .bim .fam. .bed

The list of duplicate SNPs were generated by running;
 
cut -f 2 converted .bim | sort | uniq -d > filename

on the bim.file

The converting process was then repeated but with 
--exlude filename
command in plink2, which result in a new plink v1.9 fileset
 without duplicate SNPs
