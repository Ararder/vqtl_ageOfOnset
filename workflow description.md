Following is a description of the workflow of the project.

UK Biobank genetic data was stored at the UPPMAX Bianca cluster, in BGEN format.

The analysis software used to generate the vQTL analysis requires genetic data input in plink binary format (.bed , .fam , .bim)
(https://cnsgenomics.com/software/osca/#vQTLAnalysis)

Code used for converting bgen to plink binary is named bgen_to_pbinary.sh
